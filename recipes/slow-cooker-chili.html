        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The leaves are falling and a hearty meal would hit the spot. This is where my slow cooker chili recipe comes in handy. This dish requires minimal prep time which means that you can spend your day relaxing out in the cool, fall weather and coming back in to enjoy a piping hot bowl of chili.</p>
